### Anonymous request
Given that this request is done without being logged in, it need to be authenticated against the API. It's recommended that the portal administrator creates an specific user with minimal permissions in order to allow this operation.


## Attributes

| Attribute | Data type | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------| 
|  `anonymousApiUserName` | `string` | The user name, email adress, or userId (depending on portal's authentication method) to use for authenticate this request. |
|  `anoymousApiPassword` | `string` | The password to be used to authenticate this request. |
|  `companyId` | `number` | When set, the authentication is done for a user within the especified company. If the value is 0, the company especified in `LiferayServerContext` will be used. |
|  `autologin` | `boolean` | Whether or not the user will be logged in after sucessful sign up. |
|  `saveCredentials` | `boolean` | Whether or not the user credentials and attributes will be stored in the keychain after a sucessful log in. It's ignored if `autologin` is disabled. |


## Delegate

This widget will delegate some event in an object that conforms `SignUpWidgetDelegate` protocol.
If the `autologin` is enabled, login events will be delegated to an object conforming `LoginWidgetDelegate`. Refer to [LoginWidget documentation](LoginWidget.md) for more details on this.

The `SignUpWidgetDelegate` protocol allows to implement the following methods:

- `onSignUpResponse(boolean)`: called when sign up is successfully completed. The user attributes are passed as a dictionary of keys (NSStrings) and values (NSObject). Keys supported are the same as [portal's User entity](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6.2.x/portal-impl/src/com/liferay/portal/service.xml#L2227)
- `onSignUpError(error)`: called when an error happened in the process. The NSError object describing the error occurred.
