# Creating Screenlets in Liferay Screens for iOS

## Important Note

*This product is under heavy development and its features aren't ready for use in production. It's being made public only to allow developers to preview the technology*.

## Introduction

This document explains the steps required to create your own screenlet. Before proceeding, you may want to read the [Architecture Guide](architecture.md) in order to understand the underlying concepts. You may also want to read the guide [How to Create Your Own Theme](theme_creation.md) in order to support the new screenlet from the Default or other themes.

The steps below walk you through creating an example screenlet for bookmarks that has the following features:

- Allows entry of a URL in a text box.
- Checks if the URL is valid and extract its title value. 
- Shows a preview image and title for user confirmation.
- Allows the user to modify the title.
- Upon user confirmation, the URL and title is sent back to the Liferay instance's Bookmark services to be saved.

You can perform these steps in your app's Xcode project. However, if you want to distribute your screenlet as a library so that other apps can use it, follow the steps described in the section *Publish Your Themes Using CocoaPods* in [Creating a Theme in Liferay Screens for iOS](theme_creation.md#publish-your-themes-using-cocoapods).

## Steps

* Create a new `xib` called `BookmarkView_default.xib`. You'll build your UI here using Interface Builder. Put in two text box fields (`UITextField`) for the URL and title. Also, add a couple of buttons to let the user retrieve the title and save the bookmark. To differentiate between these two user actions, assign a value for the `restorationIdentifier` property in each button.

* Create a new interface (protocol) called `BookmarkViewModel`. The associated attributes are `url` and `title`.

* Create a new class called `BookmarkView_default` that extends `BaseScreenletView` and conforms `BookmarkViewModel`. It must wire all UI components and events from the `xib` using the standard `@IBOutlet` and `@IBAction`. Getters and setters from `BookmarkViewModel` should, respectively, get and set the data from UI components. Also be sure to write any animations or front end code here.

* Set `BookmarkView_default` as the custom class of your `BookmarkView_default.xib` file.

* Create a class called `BookmarkScreenlet` that extends `BaseScreenlet`.

* Optionally, you can add any `@IBInspectable` property to configure the behavior. For example, you could use a boolean property to configure whether the user can save broken URLs.

* Override the `onUserAction` method so that it receives both button actions. Use the `name` parameter to differentiate between the following actions. These strings should be set in the `Restoration ID` attribute of the trigger component (for example, `UIButton` or others):

    - `"check"`: Occurs when the "Add bookmark" button is touched. 
    - `"save"`: Occurs when the "Confirm" button is touched.

* Write two operation classes that extend `ServerOperation`. Override the `doRun` method to perform the operation. Also override the `validateData` method to check if the data stored in `BookmarkViewModel` is valid. These two operation classes are described here:

    - `GetSiteTitleOperation`: Retrieves content from start of the HTML to the `<title>` tag. This results in the title being extracted from the HTML.
    - `LiferaySaveBookmarkOperation`: Sends the URL and title to the Liferay instance's Bookmark services.

* In the screenlet's `onUserAction` method, create and start these operations:

    - When `name` argument is `"check"`: Create and start `GetSiteTitleOperation`. The closure specified should get the retrieved title and set it to the associated `BookmarkViewModel` using the `screenletView`. If the operation fails, show the error to the user.
    - When `name` argument is `"save"`: Get the URL and title from `BookmarkViewModel` and create a `LiferaySaveBookmarkOperation` object with these values. Start the operation and set the closure to show the success or failure to the user.

* You're done! Now you can add your new screenlet to your storyboard as usual and use it as a ready-to-use component.
